### On GitHub Directly
1. Copy the raw contents of TEMPLATE.md by clicking Ctrl + C
   - or whatever other means you might employ to copy content
2. Click `Add a New File`, name it ``/pages/yourname.md`` and paste the contents of TEMPLATE.md into your new file
3. Edit ``yourname.md`` as you see fit
   - Add images, styling (style.css), anything you want
4. Commit to master or create a PR and we'll get it merged!

### Locally - developer style
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the following command `cp TEMPLATE.md pages/yourname.md`, replacing `yourname` with **your name**
3. Edit your newly created file
   - add images, styling...
4. Commit directly to master OR create a PR and we'll get it merged!

## View Your Page
Once you've pushed a change, simply navigate to ``https://srutsam.github.io/scott-horn/pages/name``!

> Sample: [Sruthi's Page](https://srutsam.github.io/scott-horn/pages/ssamraj)

### Sandbox setup

This gh-pages based repository can be used remotely to edit the pages in bulk and add things like images/docs etc.

First of all you need a `git client` - you can find one [on this link](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

Once you have git installed you can check the whole repo here as follows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srutsam/scott-horn.git
```

Once you have the repo checkout locally you are going to want to learn a bit more about

[![](https://docsify.js.org/_media/icon.svg) docsify](https://docsify.js.org) this is the tool that creates the nice site.

### TL;DR

Install Node.js here (to get npm if not already installed)

```bash
https://nodejs.org/en/
```

Install docsify

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Change into the LShop git repo (cloned from above) and run:

```bash
docsify serve
```

Enjoy a local version for testing and offline goodness of all things LShop.
