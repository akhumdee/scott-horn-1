Story-time! Write about your favorite (or not so favorite) memory with Scott. Include pictures, if you have them!

* Daily Trading Meeing (DTM) - creating a playlist to automate the agenda.
* Cutting of HIW so that we could focus on the PWA Migration
* Chicago in December of 2018 - and eating at a nice restauraunt with Sruthi and Scott.
* We took a road trip in the fall of 2019 as a bonding experience, and that was absolutely wonderful time of bonding and traveling.  
* Scott took the needed hard stance against two cloud initiatives...  Expweb to the cloud.  why is that an LShop problem?...   Segment migration for the lshop stack.  what's the return versus the risk.
* Scott had a steadfast commitment to our ways of working, and the squad model. 
* I took scott sailing on Duck Dodge in the summer of 2018 - he had no idea what he was getting into ;)


## Things only Scott Says

- Whatch out for the drop bears.

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- I will miss Scott's good humor and thick skin.  There were constant battles that must have been going on that he did a tremendous job of shielding the team from.
- I will miss Scott's relentless drive to get people to work together, and be a better version of themselves.


## Anything Else?
On the bright side, I will have a place to hangout in Denmark if anyone ever gets to travel again :)
