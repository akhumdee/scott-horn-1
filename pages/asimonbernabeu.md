# Memories with Scott Horn

- My first DTM when I introduced myself as Location Discovery tpm and Scott told me that if thats the case, the day that Location Discovery is not needed Im out.
- Waiting in line for Z&Y restaurant in San Francisco. He complained all the time.
- Good insights for different ways to approach bots management. We have not been able to leverage them though it open my mind to think differently.

# What Will I Miss About Scott
- His directness and honesty. No sugar-coded messages, so no room for confusion.
- His maker attitude and system thinking vision for Lshop.


# Anything Else?
It has been a pleasure working with you Scott. One of the bolder leaders I had the pleasure to work with and a true advocate for team culture.
Good luck on your new adventure! and good luck trying to learn danish!
