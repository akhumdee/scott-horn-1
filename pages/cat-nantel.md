# Cat (Catherine) Nantel
TPM. The "new" one in Sydney with the same name as your wife.New Australian; with a strange accent. 


## Memories with Scott Horn
Our first  mins catch up in Bellevue was too short so we had to schedule two more 30 mins in a crazzy busy week to go through all the topics we wanted to cover. 
Can't beleive this was more than a year ago now. You're probably due a new Vegemite jar...
Joining you and some LShop team members at that bar in Bellevue. You and the team were so welcoming to a random (me)!


## Things only Scott Says
- calling me "Catherine" (then after apologising, calling me "Cat")


## What I Will Miss About Scott
- your candidness and transparency (ahem, except for a new job) 
- your trust in your team
- and many other things I'm sure but we didn't work together long enough!!!


## Anything Else?
Is this the place where I leave this quote: "why does this person still have a job?"...

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to join this wonderful team. I'll be forever thankful.
