## Memories with Scott Horn

So so many! How to choose? I will remember the essence of Makerism, the essence of Making it at Bakes, the great axe throwing with alcohol event and what an electric scooter (Scotter?) looks like.

## Things only Scott Says

- What is AFR and why are you working on it?
- {from computer left unattended - not naming names} I am buying LShop lunch today!

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- Squads
- Squads
- Squads
- Oh i forgot to mention _Squads_


## Anything Else?
Was really looking forward to arriving at office and you already being there. Sigh. Will remember your leadership and how you turned a bunch of folks that happened to show up at the same place everyday _a family_. Best of Luck, Make it Danish style!
