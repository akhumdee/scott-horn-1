## Memories with Scott Horn

I vividly remember Scott grilling me about a squad extension proposal in a slack thread (I'm sure a lot of people have a similar experience). I thought to myself, wow his points are valid but he is so rigid! We set up a 1:1 to discuss face-to-face and I greatly appreciated his vulnerability and openness and realized that on mediums like slack, tone gets lost in translation. Scott genuinely cares about building the best experience and the best team and I will miss that greatly!

## Things only Scott Says

- How will you prove it?
- Do you want to bet on it?
- Imagine a world...

## What I Will Miss About Scott

- First off, I'll miss all of the wisdom that you've shared in our 1:1's, although we rescheduled A LOT, when we did end up meeting, I always learned something new
- I'll miss the way you challenge me and the rest of the team to build a better experience for our travelers
- I'll miss the way you challenge our entire Lodging Shopping team to build a better culture and process


## Anything Else?

Thank you for making Lodging Shopping the best team to work for, you were a pivotal part of building the culture of our team and your leadership has had a significant impact on the rest of Expedia. Good luck on your next adventure!
