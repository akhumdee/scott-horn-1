## Memories with Scott Horn

- Introducing 'squad' model to MTB and then doing the whole thing again with LShop times 100
- Blowing the T&E budget every month with Thirsty Thursdays, thanks Scott!
- Insisting I could not walk myself home in my questionably sober state in the middle of Bellevue, in the snow, after a few Whiskey Mules

## Things only Scott Says

- "Cracker!" (Am I remembering that right?)

## What I Will Miss About Scott

- His enthusiasm and active role supporting women in tech
- Hi ability to get the 'deers caught in a headlight' look from his team by asking the hard questions


## Anything Else?
Good luck on your external rotation! See you next time.
