## Memories with Scott Horn
Where to begin, while I've had so many laughs from your analogies and general dry wit, I've enjoyed all of the times I've gotten to see you in person. Whether it was the colorful drink named the Crawford you sipped on during some deep conversations in Chicago or the margaritas that gave us liquid courage in Seattle, you always had a drink that stood out :) You've been the engineering partner that I've always hoped to have had and I'll always appreciate that we never needed a 1:1 to be on the same page.

## Things only Scott Says
- Any of your analogies but especially the UFO with multiple alien tentacles trying to grab the villagers
- What's the most colorful drink you have?
- Matt is my favorite product partner

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- Your candidness
- Your sarcastic comments

While I am sad to see you leave, you leave behind a culture of makers that has been transformed from your leadership. Your approach, mentorship and push for all of us to be a better version of ourselves has left LShop a culture that everyone envies. Best of luck my friend on your next adventure and looking forward to visiting Copenhagen one day!
