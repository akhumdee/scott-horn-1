# Your Name
Director and pain in Scott's neck. Rebel among his directs. The one with the empty playlist

# Memories with Scott Horn
Hands down the memory would be our infamous  road trip. Honestly, the story behind this is some what interesting. We had initially planned for Scott+directs offsite in Chicago. But then the idea of a road trip popped up and the rest is history.
Best team offiste ever!

Story-time! Write about your favorite (or not so favorite) memory with Scott. Include pictures, if you have them!
Scott will no "Go with the flow". He's more of a Salmon, "Up the river". On the case of the pitcure up the dune!

## Things only Scott Says

- How would *you* do it? (emphasis on you, when he's given a suggestion to do something)
