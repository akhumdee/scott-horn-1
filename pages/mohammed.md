Director and pain in Scott's neck. Rebel among his directs. The one with the empty playlist

# Memories with Scott Horn
Hands down the memory would be our infamous  road trip. Honestly, the story behind this is some what interesting. We had initially planned for Scott+directs offsite in Chicago. But then the idea of a road trip popped up and the rest is history.
Best team offiste ever!

Scott will not "Go with the flow". He's more of a Salmon, "Up the river". In the case of the pitcure up the dune!

## Things only Scott Says

- How would *you* do it? (emphasis on you, when he's given a suggestion to do something) 
- What's the value of doing it?

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- His persistance to realize the fullest potential to his ideas.
- His extremely candid nature
- His faith in people to improve beyond what they see in themselves


## Anything Else?
The most challenging boss I had who pushed me the hardest and I enjoyed every bit.
