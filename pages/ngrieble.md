## Memories with Scott Horn

All the fun happy hours debating the pros and cons of the American lifestyle.

## Things only Scott Says

- Why is the American "walk" symbol a white guy? (Opposed to the Australian green guy...)
- Your choice in IDE is wrong
- If you can wait 5 minutes for a build maybe you don't have enough stuff to do
- In Australia....
- Sounds like you're volunteering...

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- His candor and honesty. I never had to question how he felt about something. You knew off the bat if it was a terrible idea.
- The way he somehow got us all to happy hours once, twice, sometimes three times a week. Really helped me bond with this team.
- Taught me to not just do something because the person in charge says to do it. Question everything (with reason).

## Anything Else?
Good luck and stay in touch!
