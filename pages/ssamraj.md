## Memories with Scott Horn
We started in LShop at the same time - Scott, you moved to Seattle from Brisbane and thought it was fantastic; I moved from Chicago and thought it was just ok.
I still remember our first 1-1 where I perfectly understood you, and you couldn't understand me - example: I said 'cooking' and you heard 'cocaine'

## Things only Scott Says
### At DTM or any meeting
- Since you brought it up why don't you take action on it?
- Why are we still supporting this *<insert name of any old codebase>*?
- Can you prove it?

### About Technology
- Caches. We don't need them.
- If they can't create a simple GitHub page, with markdown, why do they work in technology?
- [Everything is a Re-mix](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/)

### About a country that's not Australia
- In Australia, we have screw-top (twist-top) wine bottles, why doesn't :us: do that?
- The coffee isn't that good here.

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- Telling him that he's wrong
   - Corked wine is usually better, more expensive wine ([Read the reasoning here](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/01/02/259128689/cork-versus-screw-cap-dont-judge-a-wine-by-how-its-sealed), it's not as simple as you think, Scott!)

- Insisting that he walks on the left side of the pavement/sidewalk and explaining why he does it every single time

- Trying to convince me that I'll like visiting Australia, despite all the snakes and spiders that will eat you alive

- Visiting Bake's Place every day after work (or the fancier French bistro!)

# Anything Else?
Scott, I've said this before and I'll say it again, it was a pleasure and privilege to have known you as a colleague, boss (Sly Stalone not considered), and friend.
Every conversation I've had with you has been thought provoking, a time for *whinging*, table-flipping, and really just engaging that I walked away every time having learned something new.

> P.S. Do learn Danish. It's a fun language :smile: and has a plethora of proverbs and phrases that are right up your alley!
