## Memories with Scott Horn
We started in LShop at the same time - Scott, you moved to Seattle from Brisbane and thought it was fantastic. I moved from Chicago and thought it was just ok.

My first 1-1 with Scott was us talking about HIW's BOM upgrades and why we couldn't automate it. Yes, it set the precedent for every conversation I'd have with him later.

## Things only Scott Says
### At DTM or any meeting
- Since you brought it up why don't you take action on it?
- Why are we still supporting this <insert name of any old codebase>?
- Can you prove it?

### About Technology
- Caches. We don't need them.
- If they can't create a simple GitHub page, with markdown, why do they work in technology?

### About a country that's not Australia
- In Australia, we have screw-top (twist-top) wine bottles, why doesn't America do that?
-

## What I Will Miss About Scott
- Telling him that he's wrong
   - Corked wine is usually better, more expensive wine ([Read the reasoning here](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/01/02/259128689/cork-versus-screw-cap-dont-judge-a-wine-by-how-its-sealed), it's not as simple as you think, Scott!)
- Insisting that he walks on the left side of the pavement/sidewalk and explaining why he does it every single time
- Trying to convince me that I'll like visiting Australia, despite all the snakes and spiders that will eat you alive
- PBRs and bright, fruity cocktails at Bake's

# Anything Else?
